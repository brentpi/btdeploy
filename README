This is my ImagePE/BTDeploy project.  To use, drop the ghost files in Program Files\Ghost,
then the imagex files in System32 [so you have System32/Servicing and imagex.exe in system32].
Doesn't matter if you duplicate files, as wim's only contain one instance of each file.

Modify ImagePE.BAT to add your drivers as per your requirements.

Ignore any specific stuff to my network [ip addresses].  This was a script i made for work,
that i completed in my own time [for copyright reasons].
